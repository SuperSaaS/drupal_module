SuperSaaS Online Appointment Scheduling - Drupal 7 module

SuperSaaS.com is a flexible online appointment scheduling system that works with many different businesses and is available in 24 languages. The basic version is free, a paid version is available for large users and commercial uses.

The module displays a "Book now" button that automatically logs the user into a SuperSaaS schedule using his Drupal user name. It passes the user's information along, creating or updating the user's information on SuperSaaS as needed. This saves users from having to log in twice.

- Copy all files to a 'supersaas' directory inside 'sites/all/modules', then enable the module.
- Make sure to make the appropriate configuration settings on both your Drupal admin pages AND your SuperSaaS admin pages.
