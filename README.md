# SuperSaaS Online Appointment Scheduling -- Drupal 7 Module

The SuperSaaS Drupal 7 module displays a "Book now" button that automatically logs the user into a SuperSaaS schedule using his Drupal user name. It passes the user's information along, creating or updating the user's information on SuperSaaS as needed.

Note that you will need to configure both the WordPress plugin *and* your SuperSaaS account. Please read the setup instructions at:

___Warning: If you do not ask your users to log in to your own website, you should follow the general instructions on how to [integrate a schedule](http://www.supersaas.com/info/doc/integration "Integration | Integrate a schedule in your website") in your website. The module provided here will only work when the user is already logged into your own Drupal site.___
